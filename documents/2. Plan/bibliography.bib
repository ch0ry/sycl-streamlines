	abstract = {Although there has been significant research in {GPU} acceleration, both of parallel simulation codes (i.e., {GPGPU}) and of single {GPU} visualization and analysis algorithms, there has been relatively little research devoted to visualization and analysis algorithms on {GPU} clusters. This oversight is significant: parallel visualization and analysis algorithms have markedly different characteristics - computational load, memory access pattern, communication, idle time, etc. - than the other two categories. In this paper, we explore the benefits of {GPU} acceleration for particle advection in a parallel, distributed-memory setting. As performance properties can differ dramatically between particle advection use cases, our study operates over a variety of workloads, designed to reveal insights about underlying trends. This work has a three-fold aim: (1) to map a challenging visualization and analysis algorithm - particle advection - to a complex system (a cluster of {GPUs}), (2) to inform its performance characteristics, and (3) to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of using the {GPU}. In our performance study, we identify which factors are and are not relevant for obtaining a speedup when using {GPUs}. In short, this study informs the following question: if faced with a parallel particle advection problem, should you implement the solution with {CPUs}, with {GPUs}, or does it not matter?},
